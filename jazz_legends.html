        <h1>Jazz Legends - Miles Davis</h1>
        <p>Miles Davis is known to many as one of the world's finest jazz 
           musicians and an outstanding trumpet player.  He also earned a
           great deal of respect in the word of music as an innovative
           bandleader and composer.</p>
        <h2>Styles of Miles</h2>
        <p>Miles Davis played and wrote in a variety of styles throughout his
           career from tunes that have become jazz standards to his more
           experimental improvisational work.</p>
        <p>In the 1950s Miles was known for a warm, rich, wispy sound and was 
           able to vary the color of his sound and pitch.  He was also adept
           in using an <acronym title="Harmon mute">HM</acronym>.  In the 1960s Miles began to play more in
           the upper register.  In 1969 he even incorporated the use of
           electronic instruments in his music.</p>
        <h2>Davis the Painter</h2>
        <p>Miles' love was not only for music; he is also considered a fine
           painter.  Inspired by a Milan-based design movement known as
           Memphis, Miles painted a series of <dfn>paintings</dfn> in 1988.</p>
